Here I discuss the topic of engagement in planning and the issue this project aims to solve. Hopefully you can provide feedback, suggestions and any ideas.

## What is engagement?

 The optimal sociopolitical outcome in a democratic society is one wherein the expenditure of public funds is "for the people". If we make the assumption that tax money should be used to improve the most amount of lives in the most effective manner, a level of agreement must be reached between the people who *use* public infrastructure and the people who get to *spend* such money on *building* public infrastructure. City planning as a discipline has sought to bridge the disconnect between the will of the public and the will of governments.   For a municipal government to grow and manage their city in such a way that serves those who live/play/work in their city, they must either: (a) do what the public wants, or (b) persuade the public to appreciate what they are doing. Over the past few decades, however, Planners have realized that the latter strategy is problematic.

A couple of years ago, a Vancouver city planner and I were discussing engagement in Vancouver. She expressed how she *hated* the concept of a "Town hall meeting". She went on to say how meetings as such only seek to *inform* the public rather than capture public opinion. Town hall meetings typically look like this:

In a meeting like this, a city will showcase what they are doing, what they are planning, then ask for feedback at the end of the meeting. While everyone is welcome to a town hall meeting, there are time and place constraints that restrict who can attend. This traditional form of engagement is a prime example of what planners are moving away from: top-down, informative meetings that produce very little dialogue.

It can be said that municipalities are making progress in this regard, especially in recent years. Their goal has been to *increase* dialogue, rather than merely persuade. The preferred outcome of this progress is to establish a sense of harmony between public opinion and public works. 

IN a famous and well-cited paper written in 1969, Sherry Arnstein proposed the ladder of Citizen Participation. The ladder, for those who are unfamiliar with planning literature, articulates how the public is engaged at different levels of involvement. The ladder is essentially a spectrum of decision making power between officials and the public. The top rungs of the ladder are methods of engagement which give the public the most amount of power.<img src="https://organizingengagement.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Ladder-of-Citizen-Participation-Illustration-Sherry-Arnstein-1969-Journal-of-the-American-Planning-Association.jpg" alt="This is the original 1969 illustration of Sherry Arnsteinâ€™s Ladder of Citizen Participation as it appeared in the Journal of the American Planning Association." style="zoom:50%;" />

The town hall example I gave you earlier would fall into the relatively low 3rd and 4th rungs due to it's informative nature. Sherry Arnstein drew this concept in 1969. It has since been argued by the academic side of planning that the most equitable way to plan is by engaging at higher rungs of the ladder. Naturally, with increased public involvement, there is greater opportunity for diverse public opinion.

## Capturing public opinion

With the ladder in mind, a central research objective of mine lies in understanding how we can capture public opinion **effectively**. Importantly, there is a forgotten difference between just *general* public opinion and *diverse* public opinion. The question I always ponder when I see municipalities engaging the public, is: 

#### "*who* is being engaged?"

This question should be asked more often, because the sad reality is, there is a fundamental problem with how Canadian cities are engaged. Canadian municipalities  [do not **track** *who* is being engaged](https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/handle/1807/79195). They believe that in order to treat everyone equally, engagers must skip this step in the query process. I would argue, rather, that equal treatment is **significantly** different from equitable public opinion.  Women, children, and people of colour may or may not be severely underrepresented in the engagement process, and we would never know. The problem, then, is how Canadian municipalities turn a blind eye to this metric. The worst should be assumed. 

## Being critical of current engagement strategies

Despite not having any explicit data from ongoing engagement turnouts in Canadian municipalities, we can still be critical of their methods and how they may be presenting inequities. Groups that have been traditionally excluded from the conversation are women, children and minorities. [Research done by Dr. Jill Clark at Ohio State University](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320827557_Designing_Public_Participation_Managing_Problem_Settings_and_Social_Equity) found that **unless engagers are paying explicit attention to disenfranchised groups, their engagement process is inherently inequitable**. 

### This is where my work intersects. 

**All Voices** works to include these groups directly by using web-based civic engagement technologies. My study will begin this term (Winter 2022) by reviewing literature on privacy, human computer interaction, inclusionary design, and existing web-based civic engagement technologies under my supervisors [Dr. Raghav Sampangi](https://www.dal.ca/faculty/computerscience/faculty-staff/raghav-sampangi.html) from the Faculty of Computer Science (Dalhousie U.) and [Carla Heggie (CIAPP)](https://www.dal.ca/faculty/management/school-of-information-management/faculty-staff/faculty/carla-heggie.html) from the School of Information Management (Dalhousie U.). By synthesizing this literature, the hopeful outcome will aid in paving a path forward for my independent research project next year where I will be building an alpha release of an open source web application. 

Throughout the term I will be posting updates. Follow along, comment and/or provide feedback by connecting with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mathew-dodds-6127a0125)! I will be sharing these articles there as they come out.
