If you are visiting this page you have likely been invited to participate in a research study being conducted by me, Mathew Dodds, a graduate Urban Planning student at Dalhousie University. Firstly, thank you for stopping by and considering volunteering. All volunteers are greatly appreciated. 

As mentioned, I study urban planning. I study how to plan cities so they better serve everyone. My *research* explores how municipal governments can utilize web/internet technologies to communicate with their residents. 

I want to start off by answering some Frequently Asked Questions:

Your first question may be, **how long will this take?** 

About 10-15 minutes. I am very appreciative of every minute you spend while participating.

Then you might be wondering **what will I be doing?**

This is an online research survey. To begin the survey, you can click the secure link below when you are ready. You will first be asked to provide some <u>optional</u> information about yourself--in particular, your age, visible minority status, town/neighbourhood, and spoken languages.  This data will only be collected to be used for research. It is helpful for me as a researcher. You will then be asked a series of multiple choice, rating, and ranking questions. Most questions in this survey will ask you to rate something from 1-5.  There are different scales for the different questions being asked. This study respects your privacy and will NOT ask you for your name, address, or any contact information. This study will NOT track your IP address. 

Finally, you might be wondering, **why should I care? What is this study all about?**

I think it is important for you to have some motivation to volunteer beyond just helping a student. The long-term objective of this research is to improve "online engagement tools"--which are typically websites used by municipal governments to engage their residents. A typical use of "online engagement" will be for gauging public opinion regarding a new Community Plan. For example, the City of Surrey recently launched a website to ask residents of Guildford what they would like their community to look like in the future. This website is an example of online engagement.

Online engagement has the ability to make cities fair for everyone.  The internet is highly accessible and should be used to include more people in the process of planning communities. If more voices are heard, then the city will be planned to reflect the will of its people. 

By participating in this study, you are contributing to new research regarding online engagement and its improvement.
